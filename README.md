## About
My personal website for showcasing my software development portfolio. Currently a work-in-progress but is mostly complete. 

## How I built it
I created this website using Vite, React, and Nodejs. Additionally, I deployed my site to the web using Netlify and my custom domain. 

## Challenges I ran into
- Making sure client-side routing works on page refresh and manually typed urls
- Deploying and configuring my website with a custom domain
- Using a suitable color palette for both light and dark mode
## What I Learned
 - Basics of CI/CD with Github Actions
 - Animating page transitions and components in React with Framer Motion
 - Configuring Custom domains with Netlify

## What's next
- Integrating Github API or webhooks to load project data
- Creating an API to fetch portfolio data
- Adding a work experience section (once I get relevant work experience 😅)
